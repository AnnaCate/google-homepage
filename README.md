This is my first project to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS. It's a clone of the Google homepage.

I learned how to write and edit basic HTML and CSS, as well as practiced using Git and the Chrome developer tools.

See the live page <a href="https://annacate.github.io/google-homepage/">here</a>

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
